<h2 id="title">Foolish Ideas About Marriage</h2>
<center>
    <div class="cont">
    <p>It is surprising how many foolish ideas there are about marriage. Many of them are concocted by well-meaning but wholly unrealistic people, particularly those who write sentimental love stories. Most of these ideas are figments of the imagination. Anyone can fall for them if he has not been informed. Here are a few of these completely erroneous ideas.
        “These two were just made for each other.” This is nonsense. It may look good in a story, but it is purely imaginary. People have to grow together. They have to learn each other’s ways before they can live happily together. If they have common interests and a common background, they are more likely to make a success of their marriage. But even then there are plenty of failures.
        Adam and Eve were the only one who were “made for each other.” They had plenty of trouble in their family! Let us look at another of these fallacies.
        “This was love at first sight.” There is no such thing. Love does not spring up like a weed. True love grows slowly. It takes time. People may be attracted to each other, but this is not real love. It may only be infatuation. Do not mistake this for genuine love. Let us look at another piece of modern fiction.
        “This will be a perfect marriage.” Don’t you believe it. There are no perfect marriages. Nor are there any “ideal couples.” Some people seem to have fewer problems to meet simply because they are less selfish and less demanding of their partners. But every home has its problems. None are perfect. It is foolish to blind yourself to these difficulties, thinking that things will be different in your case. Human experience reveals that you will have to go through the same problems that most other people face.
