    <p>What about running away and getting married? 
        Is this advisable? Much depends upon the circumstances surrounding you.
         In most cases it is decidedly foolish to run off and get married elsewhere. 
         What are you running away from? Perhaps if you took a little more time, 
         you might see things in a clearer light. Even though after waiting you may be 
         still  of the same opinion, your family may have had opportunity to change their minds 
         and agree with you. In any case waiting a little will not hurt you. 
        Donâ€™t be in a hurry.
