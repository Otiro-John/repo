<p>There are certain kinds of individuals that a wise young person will avoid becoming involved with. They are not suitable as life partners. Here are some of the obvious types of individuals that one should avoid:<br>
1.	A changeable person. These are unable to make up their own minds. They are likely to prove unfaithful in the years to come. Their instability arises from some deep neurosis.
<br>
2.	A selfish person, one who is domineering and must always have his own way. Such people are not well balanced. They do not settle down to married life very well.
<br>
3.	A dishonest person. Even in the smallest things one should always be strictly on the level. There is nothing but trouble with a person who is basically dishonest. 
<br>
4.	A jealous person. These are in love with themselves . They are always  insecure and unhappy. Don’t marry this kind of person.
<br>
5.	A sexy person is a bad risk at any time. Beware of anyone who is always paying great attention to the other sex. Such people cannot be trusted. They are not stable individuals. Usually they are suffering from some type of neurosis. Such a person is not likely to make a success of marriage or of anything else.
<br>
Young people need to remember that marriage never changes a person’s character. Too many girls have married alcoholics in the hope of reforming them. The experience of millions of unhappy people proves the uselessness of this kind of marriage. Marriage never reforms anyone. It often deepens a person’s problems and makes life miserable for all concerned.
If you are planning to get married, be sure it is a sensible partnership. Both of you need to be mature. You need to have common interests and similar goals in life. No marriage can be successful if one is pulling in one direction and the other in another. Such a situation is exceedingly difficult for the children. It is wiser if you both have the same religious principles and ideals. You should be equally intelligent and willing to adjust to each other’s needs and desires.
Going out on a date is often the first step toward marriage. Is this person with whom you are going likely to be the one whom you would naturally choose for a life partner? When you are married, you have to take the bitter with the sweet. You are married “for better or  for worse.” Once you have stepped in there is no easy way out. You had better weigh the matter carefully. It is well to take your parents into your counsel. I f they do not approve, there may be good reason. They probably know you better than you know yourself. Often some good friend of the family is in a position to advice you. But beware of someone who is a matchmaker. Such a person may be doing this “for the fun of it.” You may be the victim. Do not trust anyone of this type.
