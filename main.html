        <p>FALLING in love is a most delightful experience, especially during the teen years. In fact, it is about the only kind of falling that we ever enjoy. But at such time we are not always too responsible for our actions. That is why it is so important to think before you date. Many young people think they are in love with someone when, in reality they are in love with life.
        Every young girl is naturally romantic. This is one of the loveliest things about the female personality. In spite of all life’s problems, most young women persist in seeing things not as they are, but as they would like them to be. That is why they are always moving the furniture around or buying new hats or demonstrating all the other female characteristics.
        But being romantic also has its dangers. Our emotions are not always dependable. They are far stronger than our intellect. They can make everything seem so attractive to a girl that in the end she loses all sense of proportion. If there is one person who should always keep her feet on the ground, it is the young woman who thinks that she is in love. She has so much to lose if she takes the wrong turn. Nature has wisely arranged things so that the girl matures at an earlier age. This gives her several more years to think things over. Believe me, she needs that extra time.
        Young women need to be very particular in their choice of associates. It is far better to have few friends, rather than to have many acquaintances of the wrong type. An enormous responsibility rests on every teen-age girl, for she carries within herself the possibilities of another home and family. What kind of home will it be? What kind of person will she choose to be her life partner? These are the questions that every young girl should seriously ask herself.
        The three most important events in life are these: birth, marriage, and death. We have no control over the first and often very little over the third. The only event over which we have any real control is marriage. And what a mess so many seem to make of it!
        Before you go out on a date, you would be wise to think about it for a while. Don’t blind yourself to the fact that going out on a date is not a simple matter. There are always certain implications in it and perhaps some risk. Most people have the idea that a girl can easily control her feelings and that she can keep  her emotions under control. This may be true, but it is only partly right. There comes a time in everyone’s experience when nature takes over, and the girl seems unable to hold herself in check. These are things young women cannot afford to over look.
        Nature has gone to considerable trouble to develop certain glands within the female body that make her highly attractive to the male. She should not be too surprised to discover that, under certain circumstances, these drives and urges within may sometimes get completely out of control. Even the wisest woman can become utterly foolish if she allows herself to be completely carried away by her emotional drives. Anyone who does this is running an enormous risk, not only to herself but to others as well.
        To meet this  problem, society has built up an elaborate code of ethics that the wise young woman will be willing to  accept. These safeguards may seem a bit out of date but in this age. But there is  a good reason why sensible young people prefer to abide by these standards of conduct. The wise man has said,” A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.”One night of loose living may ruin a person’s reputation for life. There is a very valid reason why these standards of conduct have been accepted for centuries.
